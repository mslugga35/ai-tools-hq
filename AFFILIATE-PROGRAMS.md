## Expected Monthly Revenue by Traffic

| Monthly Visitors | Affiliate Clicks (2%) | Conversions (3%) | Avg Commission | Revenue |
|------------------|----------------------|------------------|----------------|---------|
| 5,000 | 100 | 3 | $30 | $90 |
| 10,000 | 200 | 6 | $30 | $180 |
| 20,000 | 400 | 12 | $30 | $360 |
| 50,000 | 1,000 | 30 | $30 | $900 |
| 100,000 | 2,000 | 60 | $30 | $1,800 |

## Recurring vs One-Time

**Prioritize recurring commissions.** A $30/month tool with 30% recurring = $9/month per customer forever.

10 customers = $90/month passive
100 customers = $900/month passive

This compounds over time without new traffic.
